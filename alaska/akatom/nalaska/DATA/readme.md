These files are curated to provide the maximum amount of data coverage with the
minimum amount of source-stations and receiver stations for the Nalaska 
ambient noise adjoint tomography study

For Source stations, we remove stations based on a threshold value for the total
number of corresponding EGF data available. Also based on repeated or clustered
source stations

For Receiver stations, we remove any stations that do not have any corresponding
data which may have been included in the initial list because they are within
the bounding box.
