THIS IS AN UNFINISHED EXAMPLE 8/15 - BC

Examples to show off the different ways to use concurrent.futures.submit() vs.
concurrent.futures.map()

submit: more simple 'scattergun' approach, just submit all jobs without a worry
    about returns, timeouts or exceptions.
map: slightly more complex 'boomerang' approach, submit jobs but expect returns,
    cancel after timeout time, raise exceptions
