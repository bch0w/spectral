    "Used to help others write better Python code, following PEP standards for modularity, simplicity, readability etc. More or less structured from top to bottom of a python script. Not really into the territory of packages yet, but defining functions, adhereing to PEP etc. This is mostly related to coding in Python 3.7, which is currently outdated (3.10 is the most up to date version as of today), but is generally applicable to Python3\n",

    "**Docstring**: explains what a script/code does, because it is really easy to forget why you wrote something. I always start with this docstring and explain (first to myself, later to others) why I have decided to start writing code in a new file. This is a users first point of entry to your script, so the idea is that they should know what your code does before reading your code (sort of like an abstract?)\n",

    "**(optional) Line length**: I try to keep all my codes at an 80 character max line length (PyCharm, Sublime Text, Vim etc., all have ways to denote line length and even auto-wrap when you exceed, these are your friend). This is a stylistic choice and does not affect the code, but I find it looks cleaner and makes it easier to work with multiple codes at once. 80 is maybe too short for some, probably the best advice is pick a number and stick with it: 80, 120, 140, 200 are common choices."
