- SYN12 FORCESOLUTIONS are manually picked to create two concentric circles from 
available stations within the domain, used only for synthetic inversion
because there was no selection based on data
- STATION_SYN is a trim down of the original stations file to 100 stations 
which removes doubles, arrays and very close stations
