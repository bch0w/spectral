ALVIZURI\_TAPE\_2018
- Moment tensors inverted for by Alvizuri and Tape SRL 2018
- 7 tests and 3 earthquakes
- Contains a script to take their supp. table and convert to CMTSOLUTION files
- CMTSOLUTION files are in dyne * cm to be used with SPECFEM

HYPOTHETICAL\_EVENTS
- Modifications of test events or tectonic events to change location, depth,
  moment etc., but keeping the actual source mechanism the same.
- Helpful for e.g., putting a tectonic event in the NK test site

ISOTROPIC\_EXPLOSIONS
- Purely isotropic sources whose moment should match the actual test moments
- Locations from Alvizuri Tape 2018 (?)

TECTONIC\_EVENTS
- Real tectonic events from the region (China, South Korea, Japan)
- Can be used as the base file for hypothetical events
- Mechanisms taken from GCMT or from Alvizuri Tape 2018
